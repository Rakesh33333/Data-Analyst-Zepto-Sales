The analysis is based on data provided in an Excel sheet. The dataset contains approximately 8,500 rows and 12 columns of information related to Zepto sales and operations. Each row in the data represents an item sold or an order placed.

**Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**
The dashboard features four main Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) at the top, providing an overall summary of the business's performance:
• Total Sales: The overall revenue generated from all items sold.
• Average Sales: The average revenue per sale.
• Number of Items: The total count of items sold.
• Average Ratings: The average rating provided by customers for items sold.


**Project Development Steps:** The creation process followed a structured methodology:
1.Requirement Gathering/Business Requirements: Defining the specific needs.
2.Data Walkthrough: Understanding the raw data.
3.Data Connections: Connecting Power BI to the Excel data source.
4.Data Cleaning: Performing quality checks and transformations using Power Query Editor, including standardizing "Item Fat Content" values.
5.Data Modeling: Establishing relationships for multiple tables (if applicable).
6.Data Processing: Adding new rows or columns as needed.
7.DAX Calculations: Writing Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) to create measures (e.g., Total Sales, Average Sales) and implementing field parameters for dynamicmetric selection.
8.Layouting: Setting up a custom canvas size (800 pixels height, 1400 pixels width) and overall structure.
9.Chart Development and Formatting: Building and formatting various charts, including custom colors, shadows, and images for card visuals.
10.Report Generation: Assembling all charts and elements into the cohesive dashboard.
11.Insight Generation: Deriving actionable insights from each visualization and the overall dashboard.
**Tools Used**: The project primarily utilized Power BI Desktop, specifically leveraging Power Query Editor for data cleaning and DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) for calculations and measures.
